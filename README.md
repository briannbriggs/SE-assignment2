# SE-assignment2
# Description
Follow Dr. Kim's instructions word for word to complete the assignment
I am not entirely sure how to use github so do not trust me.

In order to download git, go to the github website and look up download git

Here are some basic functions to add to the repository
#clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
#Navigate into the directory
cd your-repo

Issue one: fatal not a git repository
I inititally struggled with accessing my cpp file of hello world. After some struggles I realized I had to open nano or an internal command prompt on bash. After I navigated nano it was much easier to complete the assignment. 

Issue two: fatal: unable to access "github.com/briannbriggs/SE-assignment2"
I was not connected to wifi and there for when I tried to upload my assignment progress it did not work. I am honestly not even sure if it actuallu uploaded.

# unable to find partner to complete the pair part of this assignment with as I started this late.
